=======================

Automatic time tracking for commands in Zsh using [WakaTime](http://wakatime.com/).


Installation
---

Plugin requires [WakaTime CLI](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime-cli) **6.0 or higher**.
Ensure your WakaTime API key is set up in your [~/.wakatime.cfg](https://github.com/wakatime/wakatime-cli/blob/develop/USAGE.md) file. If you use WakaTime in other editors, this file may already exist.

**1. Install WakaTime CLI**

- **Using a Python script**:  
  ```
  python3 -c "$(wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wakatime/vim-wakatime/master/scripts/install_cli.py)"
  ```

- **For Arch users**:  
  ```
  sudo pacman -S wakatime
  ```

- **For Homebrew users**:  
  ```
  brew install wakatime-cli
  ```

**2. Install the Plugin**

- **For Oh-My-Zsh users**:  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/wbingli/zsh-wakatime.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-wakatime
  ```
  Then, edit your `.zshrc` file and add `zsh-wakatime` to the list of Oh-My-Zsh plugins.

- **For Antigen users**:  
  ```
  antigen bundle wbingli/zsh-wakatime
  ```

**3. Final Steps**

- Open a new terminal and run some commands to start tracking.  
- Visit [WakaTime Dashboard](https://wakatime.com/project/Terminal) to see your stats.


Project Detection
---

By default all actions logged by the Zsh plugin for WakaTime are associated with the *Terminal* project, if you would like the plugin to attribute the project based on either git repository or the last accessed project then set `ZSH_WAKATIME_PROJECT_DETECTION` to true in your environment.

To enable:

1. Edit your `.zshrc`.
2. Add the line `export ZSH_WAKATIME_PROJECT_DETECTION=true` at the top of the file.
